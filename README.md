# Together - Contact Tracing by Self-Reporting

A mobile app to allow the general public to self-report COVID-19 cases. Data analysis from this app and official testing results can be combined and support targeted testing allocation and more efficient contact tracing.

Functions:
- A user can create case reports for self and others.
- A user can request COVID-19 diagnostics test or antibody test, schedule a test, visit the test site, getting tested and test result can be send to the user. 
- Test can be done with minimum contact. User identified himself with a QR code on the app, which is linked to the testing kit QR code in the testing site. Testing data will be sent to use on the app when available. 
- If user test positive, user can send notification to others who mighted be infected.

Future goals:
- Acquire verified government testing results, populate a map showing density of COVID infection at individual level (currently maps are only available by state, and in some case by city)
- Data analysis from self-reporting and verified testing data can be analysed, with the help of AI, to predict and forestall infection hotspots.
